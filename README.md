# Modules, Libraries and Packages
## --> Specifically pyodbc

### Libraries
- Refer to python standard libraries but do need to be imported

### Modules
- These are python files like our MonsterStudent class that we import into our programs 
- We create and import our own modules internally 

### Packages 
- These are external modules, that we need to install (externally) and then import
- These are modules usually written in OOP style, that abstract something.
- These things that are abstracted include:
-- Connection to a service (e.g. google maps or google image recognition API,or price of stocks/bitcoin)
-- Tools/ Calculators (Prime number calculator, other complex calculators)
-- Front end tools like JS compiler or other things like SCSS
-- Fully fledged frameworks
-- Connections ot databases or using HTTP protocols
